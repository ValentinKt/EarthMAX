1. Use credentials to login to the mobile app :
- Email : `valentin.jeannot@telecomnancy.net`
- Password : `azerty`
2. Commit changes regularly to the repository.
3. Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your code.
4. /!\ Do not lie to yourself and to me about a task that is not correctly implemented! /!\
5. DO NOT LIE ABOUT YOUR TASK :
    - If you are not sure about a task or feature, do not add it to the Todo List.
    - If you are sure about a task or feature, add it to the Todo List.
    - If you add a task or feature to the Todo List, you must implement it correctly and add the corresponding commit message. 
    - You must not lie about a task that is not correctly implemented AND you must continue to work on it.
7. Use a Modern, User-Friendly, Environmental (teal/green color) based for UI. The UX should be intuitive, easy to use and "juicy".
