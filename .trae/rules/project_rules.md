Add task systemically, and use the todolist name `EarthHMAX` project to manage your tasks at the URL : `https://app.todoist.com/app/project/earth-max-6Crf8qMC2PcM8MFW` 
5. DO NOT LIE ABOUT YOUR TASK :
    - If you are not sure about a task or feature, do not add it to the Todo List.
    - If you are sure about a task or feature, add it to the Todo List.
    - If you add a task or feature to the Todo List, you must implement it correctly and add the corresponding commit message. 
    - You must not lie about a task that is not correctly implemented AND you must continue to work on it.
    - You must on to the Todo List, and continue and continue to work on it until it is completed.
7. Use a Modern, User-Friendly, Environmental (teal/green color) based for UI. The UX should be intuitive, easy to use and "juicy".
