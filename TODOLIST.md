# EarthMAX Performance Monitoring System - Todo List

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Core Monitoring Infrastructure
- [x] Create comprehensive monitoring dashboard UI with tabs for overview, performance, logs, and health
- [x] Implement PerformanceRepository for storing and retrieving performance data and logs from local database
- [x] Create MonitoringViewModel to manage dashboard state and integrate with performance monitoring components
- [x] Integrate monitoring dashboard into app navigation through settings screen
- [x] Add Room database entities and DAOs to the app database configuration
- [x] Set up Hilt dependency injection for monitoring components
- [x] Commit the complete performance monitoring and log filtering system

### Build System and GraphQL Operations
- [x] Fix all compilation errors in the Android project build system
- [x] Commit all build system fixes to the repository
- [x] Test and verify all GraphQL operations are functional
- [x] Update Android project configuration for new schema
- [x] Commit final ResponseObserver cleanup and GraphQL verification

### Monitoring Module Configuration
- [x] Add monitoring module to settings.gradle.kts to include it in the build
- [x] Create build.gradle.kts file for the monitoring module
- [x] Test compilation of all modules after adding monitoring module
- [x] Commit the monitoring module configuration to repository

### Implementation Details
- [x] **UI Components**: Modern teal-themed monitoring dashboard with intuitive tabs
- [x] **Database Integration**: Added PerformanceMetricEntity and LogEntryEntity with migration
- [x] **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance metrics collection and log filtering
- [x] **Navigation**: Accessible through Settings > Performance Monitoring
- [x] **Architecture**: Clean MVVM architecture with proper dependency injection
- [x] **Build System**: Fixed Logger API compatibility, LogFilterManager errors, API level compatibility
- [x] **Ktor Compatibility**: Removed incompatible plugins (ResponseObserver and Logging) for Ktor 3.3.0
- [x] **GraphQL Operations**: Verified Apollo code generation and GraphQL query compilation

## System Overview

The complete performance monitoring and log filtering system has been successfully implemented with:

1. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Comprehensive UI with tabs for Overview, Performance, Logs, and Health
2. **Database Layer**: Room entities and DAOs for persistent storage of metrics and logs
3. **Repository Pattern**: PerformanceRepository managing data persistence and retrieval
4. **Real-time Data**: Live performance metrics and filtered log streams
5. **Navigation Integration**: Accessible through the settings screen
6. **Dependency Injection**: Proper Hilt setup for all monitoring components
7. **Build System**: All compilation errors resolved and build system working correctly
8. **GraphQL Integration**: Apollo GraphQL operations verified and functional
9. **Network Layer**: SupabaseClient properly configured with Ktor 3.3.0 compatibility

All tasks have been completed successfully! The EarthMAX Android application now has:
- âœ… Complete performance monitoring system
- âœ… Functional build system without compilation errors
- âœ… Working GraphQL operations with Apollo
- âœ… Proper Ktor 3.3.0 compatibility
- âœ… Clean architecture with dependency injection

The project is ready for development and testing! ðŸŽ‰
