## System Overview

The EarthMAX Android application now features a robust architectural foundation with:

### Repository Pattern Implementation
1. **Data Layer**: Clean separation with repository implementations
2. **Domain Layer**: Use case modules with proper dependency injection
3. **Core Layer**: Shared utilities, monitoring, and security components
4. **Dependency Injection**: Comprehensive Hilt modules for all layers

### Monitoring and Performance
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection and analysis
2. **Network Monitoring**: Connectivity status and type detection
3. **Metrics Collection**: Counters, gauges, and timer statistics
4. **Security Utilities**: Encryption, hashing, and input validation

### Configuration and Security
1. **Application Configuration**: Centralized constants and feature flags
2. **Security Framework**: Password validation, encryption, and sanitization
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management across layers
4. **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent data caching with performance optimization

The project maintains clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive monitoring, and robust security measures. All components are properly integrated with dependency injection and follow Android development best practices.

Ready for the next phase of architectural improvements! ðŸš€
